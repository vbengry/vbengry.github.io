        <h2><u>Background</u></h2>
        <p>I have worked throughout my college career as I am responsible for funding my education. While often working multiple jobs at once, I have been able to grow my skills and secure the funds needed for my college education. These roles have allowed me to develop my expertise in complex operations while refining my ability to simplify complicated technical processes for non-technical audiences. Additionally, this has provided me with skills in organization, multi-tasking, teamwork, customer service, and leadership. It has not been easy but it has taught me how rewarding it can be to achieve my goals through hard work.</p>
        <p>I have found success and have recently become a team lead in my current position. I have taken over 1000 phone calls and have worked with full-time staff. I look forward to working with scheduling and hiring in the near future.</p>
